For this project, I chose to focus on the topic of pet-friendly travel. Recognizing the complexities of planning trips with pets due to restrictions at certain hotels, restaurants, and cafes, I saw an opportunity to streamline this process.

My project is a responsive web application built using React.js, with CSS and Bootstrap for styling. It caters to individuals who travel with their pets, offering a convenient solution to locate pet-friendly accommodations, dining establishments, and parks in the city they are visiting. This enables travelers with pets to plan their trips more efficiently.

The website comprises 3 pages. On the site's homepage, multiple sections containing information and images are available. In the header section, there is a search bar that allows users to search for the city they wish to travel to.

If users search for, let's say, Bucharest, the list of pet-friendly hotels, restaurants, and parks in Bucharest is displayed.I have also included a filtering section on the page, which filters the data based on the type of location. For each location, I have provided a brief description, address, and phone number.

Furthermore, the website includes an "About Us" page where the backstory of the application is presented, and a "Contact Page" that features a contact form.

At the moment, the website covers seven cities in Romania: Bucharest, Iasi, Sibiu, Brasov, Cluj, Timisoara, and Constanta and the data is currently generated from a mock dataset. However, my goal is to enhance the project by integrating real data, as I believe it would provide immense value to fellow animal enthusiasts.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
